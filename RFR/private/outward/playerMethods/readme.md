## This directory contains all of the methods in the player class.

## Creating new methods is possible and encouraged, as long as you make sure to properly add them to the "methods.json" file.

## The format for method.json is `"method_name": "file_name"`

## The name of the function in the method file must be the same as the method name that is provided in method.json.

## Method files are currently not allowed to hold anything other than the method itself. Declaring any other global variables will prevent proper functionality.
